	<h2 class="section-title">Healthy Lifestyle</h2>
	<p>Balanced diet, sound sleep and regular exercise are crucial to feeling healthy and energetic. A healthy lifestyle also helps me feel good on the inside. One of my major goals this year is to mindfully practice healthy habits, combined with emotion regulation tactics.</p>

	<p>We all love the feeling of truly learning something valuable. That's why I enrolled this web development course on Coursera. I'm grateful to my workplace for offering Coursera sponsorship until the end of 2020. So I'm ready to take more challenges and learn as much as possible on Coursera!</p>

	<p>My passion is to be able to bring value and help people connect. Whether it's a product, a service, or simply a small act of kindness, I'm willing to help in any way I can.	I cannot wait to see what the future holds when I incorporate my knowledge into the world of opportunities!</p>
