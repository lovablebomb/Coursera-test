	    		<p>Balanced diet, sound sleep and regular exercise are crucial to feeling healthy and energetic. Living healthy also helps us feel good on the inside. One of my major goals this year is to mindfully practice healthy habits, combined with emotion regulation tactics.</p>

	    		<p>We all love the feeling of truly learning something valuable. That's why I enrolled this web development course on Coursera. I'm grateful to my workplace for offering Coursera sponsorship until the end of 2020. So I'm ready to take more challenges and learn as much as possible on Coursera!</p>
